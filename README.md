# Walmart-Review-Scrapping



* Implementation
I have implemented the scrapper with the help of selnium and python, For making this scrapper and to save the reviews by name,date,rating,title,description
i have to save them all by forming te loop around them.
The problem i have faced was to get the elements for different header of the reviews and the path to them changes sometimmes.so i have to check again and again
